### 2025-05-23 - Brief description
Expanded description including how much time was spent on task.
- 0500 spent 45 minutes doing initialDisplay which makes the green tiles on the screen
    Nested for loop to draw squares, put placeholder value for sizeOfTile so it compiles
### 2025-05-24 - Brief description
- Afternoon set bomb makes the window white for some reason, isFlagged and revealTile is funky and have nullpointer
- Something is wrong with setBomb, commented that out from grid constructor to test other stuff
- Holy crap. We made the double array, but never put tiles in them. They are all null. fuuuuddggeee
- added some debugging text(coordinates of click)
- put for loop in grid constructor to make tiles for every spot in array
- Afternoon 5 reveal and flag work, yay
