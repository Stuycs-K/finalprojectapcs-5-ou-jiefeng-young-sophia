    Nested for loop to draw squares, put placeholder value for sizeOfTile so it compiles

- Holy crap. We made the double array, but never put tiles in them. They are all null. fuuuuddggeee
- added some debugging text(coordinates of click)
- put for loop in grid constructor to make tiles for every spot in array
